# VestBank
A **Java Spring Boot Backend Aplication** that simulates a bank!
This project it's only for self development and studying purposes.

For now we have:
* Basic CRUD operations;
* APIs using the HTTP verbs (*GET*, *POST*, *DELETE*, *PUT*);
* A Document Oriented DataBase (MongoDB) for Accounts;

Project design follows the **MVC** standards.

For future improvements:
* Deposit and Withdraw registers in DataBase, pointing to the account;
* Messaging service to asynchronous response between the depositor/withdrawer and account owner;
